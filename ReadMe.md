   - Database creation.
   - Table creation with appropriate primary and foreign keys.
   - Insertion of sample data.
   - Queries for retrieving and manipulating data.
   - Normalization process.

2. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**:
   - A visual representation of the database structure.
   - Depicts the relationships between entities like customers, products, orders, and order items.

## Usage

1. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Execute the provided SQL script using a MySQL-compatible database management system.

2. **Queries**:
